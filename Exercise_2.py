# Exercise 2: Ohmâ€™s Law Calculator
# Instructions:
# 1.	Ask the user what they want to calculate: Voltage, Current, or Resistance.
# 2.	Based on their choice, prompt the user to input the appropriate values.
# 3.	Use Ohm's Law to calculate the missing variable and display the result.
# 4.	Handle cases where division by zero might occur.
